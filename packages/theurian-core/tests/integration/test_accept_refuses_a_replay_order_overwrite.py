"""``propose accept`` refuses a proposal that a landed migration replaying after it
would leave looser.

The guard refuses, with exit 1 and nothing moved, when the union replay ends a
gate field the proposal P wrote looser than P left it, whatever the id of the landed
migration that loosened it. The predicate is 0.5.1's floors': the class for
sensitivity, ``may_surface(..., include_unapproved=True)`` for status. The remedy is
``_redraft_remedy``'s and names ``dependsOn`` every landed migration that writes the field and
replays after P.

Which check speaks depends on the rows (GHSA-wwq9). Where accepting P would add a report
row the landed migrations alone do not report, a ``reorders`` row included, or would make a
row the history already holds name a different migration in ``undoes``, the report check
refuses first, in its words ("undoing what this proposal sets"): for instance, a smaller-id
``dependsOn`` lowering replaying after P's raise, with no id larger than P's having written
the field. Otherwise the end-state check's words ("loosen what it sets") remain.

P3: for the migration set ``accept`` replays, every floor-read label an accepted proposal
writes (sensitivity class; status surfaceability via ``may_surface(...,
include_unapproved=True)``) is, by those predicates, no looser after that replay than the
proposal left it. P3 is scoped to accepted proposals.

Not tested: a proposal that loosens, then a landed migration that tightens. A proposal
cannot loosen past 0.5.1's floors, so accept never reaches it. The tests drive the CLI
only: the guard's helper has no contract to pin yet.
