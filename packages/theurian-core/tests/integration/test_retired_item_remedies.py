"""A remedy never directs a retired item to a step the next command refuses (GHSA-v2qg-23fc-7fqp).

The draft-side refusal and the accept status floor made three older remedies
false for a retired item: each routes the reader to ``theurian propose`` or to
an ``expectedRevision`` edit, and the command that follows refuses a retired
item. For a retired item the only route back is a hand-authored ``restoreItem``
migration, so each remedy here must name it and must not name the step that is
refused.

The three faces, one test each. RED before the fix, GREEN after: the combined
refusal for a confidential and deprecated create-only item; the CLI's
missing-``--expected-revision`` refusal, which the retired refusal now wins over for a retired item;
and the replay's revision conflict, which a retired item reaches because the
MCP lookup answers it like an absent id. Each has a control showing that the
same remedy is unchanged for an item that is not retired.
