"""The governance labels and status an existing item holds, as the drafter and ``accept`` read them.

``KnowledgeItem.with_revision`` adopts sensitivity, trust level and namespace from
the revision a content update lands, so a drafted update that leaves one out is
not neutral: the loader fills in its default and the item is re-labelled with no
reviewer asked (GHSA-v2qg-23fc-7fqp). This module carries what the item currently
holds, so the drafter can restate it and ``accept`` can compare it. Status rides
with them because ``upsertRevision`` adopts ``metadata.status`` too: an update
the drafter wrote as ``approved`` readmits a retired item unless something
compares the status before and after.
