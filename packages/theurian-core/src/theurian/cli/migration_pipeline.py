"""The pipeline ``migrate apply`` runs, and the dry replay ``propose accept`` runs.

A composition root (ADR-0003): one of the places allowed to name a concrete
adapter. It exists for one reason, and the reason is ADR-0027 decision 2's hard
condition -- **``accept``'s pre-check must invoke the same engine path ``migrate
apply`` invokes, differing only in the write target.** Two functions deriving
"does this set apply?" independently agree until they do not, and the
disagreement surfaces as *"accept said yes and apply said no"* with nothing to
arbitrate. So the write-transaction/writer/engine sequence lives here once, in
:func:`apply_migration_set`, and both callers reach it.

:func:`rehearse_migration_set` adds what a *dry* run needs and nothing else: a
copy of the candidate set in a throwaway directory, a fresh empty database
beside it, and the same loader, the same whole-set guards and the same engine
over both. ADR-0005 rule 8 -- applying all migrations to an empty store
reproduces the full canonical state -- is what makes that replay well-defined
rather than an approximation; a replay that disagreed with the real apply would
be a violation of rule 8 before it was a bug in ``accept``.

The copy is a real tree because the pipeline reads one: the loader re-reads each
``upsertRevision``'s body from the path its ``contentFile`` resolves to, and an
incoming proposal's bodies are not at those paths yet. Teaching the loader about
proposals would be the second implementation the ADR forbids, so the union is
staged on disk instead and the real loader reads it.

    The single definition of what applying a migration set *is*: ``migrate
    apply`` calls it against the project's own state database, and
    :func:`rehearse_migration_set` calls it against a throwaway one. Everything
    that differs between the two arrives as an argument, so there is no branch
    here that a replay takes and a real apply does not (ADR-0027 decision 2).

    ``database_created`` is the caller's answer to "did this run create the
    database?", and it is half the condition on the surfaceable-count record
    below. The other half is ``report.changed``, which only exists once the
    apply has run, which is why the condition is evaluated here rather than by
    the caller.

    ``already_locked`` is forwarded to :func:`write_transaction` unchanged and
    defaults to ``False`` for the same reason it does there: this function does
    not know, and must not guess, whether its caller already holds
    ``write_lock``. ``migrate apply``'s own composition-root code passes
    ``True`` (#468), because its critical section acquires the lock itself
    before calling in here, to cover the database creation and pointer publish
    this function never sees. :func:`rehearse_migration_set` below passes
    neither -- it takes the default, against a throwaway lock file no other
    process can contend for.

        MigrationChecksumMismatchError: If an applied migration's file changed.

    Landed files are copied first and the incoming ones written over them, which
    is what makes the result the *union* rather than the two sets side by side:
    a body this proposal replaces is replaced here too.

    Every read goes through :func:`read_source_file`, so the copy inherits its
    containment, file-shape and size checks (SEC-7, SEC-8).

    **It does not inherit the whole of the loader's route check, and that is
    recorded rather than implied.** The body half of ``candidate.landed`` is the
    loader's own ``resolved_content_path`` -- a path ``resolve()`` has already
    flattened -- so the symlink-route walk inside :func:`read_source_file` has no
    link left to see there. What bounds these reads is the
    :func:`~theurian.security.paths.assert_no_symlink_escape` the loader made on
    the author's ``contentFile`` when the landed set was read: upstream, and on
    the one string that could still carry a route. The migration-file half is
    ``migration.source_path``, which comes from a directory listing and is not
    flattened, so for those entries the walk here is live. An earlier version of
    this paragraph claimed the copy read "under the same checks" as the loader;
    it reads under one fewer, and which one is the point. Every write is
    proved to stay under ``target`` before it happens: the relative paths come
    from the loader, which already contained them, and re-proving a *write* is
    cheaper than reasoning about whether that stays true.

    Two fidelity limits, stated because the closure argument depends on them:

    * The copy reproduces the tree's **path structure**, not its inode sharing.
      Two landed bodies hardlinked to one inode become two files here, so a
      duplicate-body collision that the real project would show through
      ``st_ino`` need not show here. Git cannot commit a live hardlink -- a
      fresh clone gets a distinct inode holding the committed blob -- so the
      documented channel cannot deliver that pair; the same residual
      ``ProposalService.accept`` already records for its own reads.
    * Case sensitivity is the filesystem's, and the temporary directory need not
      be on the same filesystem as the project. Two spellings that reach one
      file on a case-insensitive project could reach two here, or the reverse.
      This is *assumed* harmless rather than measured: the system temporary
      directory and a user's checkout are expected to share case semantics on the
      platforms this ships to, but nothing here probes it. It does not have to,
      because the real accept path keys duplicate-body detection on filesystem
      identity (``st_dev``/``st_ino``) against the *actual* project, not this copy
      (issue #210) -- so a case-fidelity mismatch here at worst costs the
      rehearsal a collision the real move still catches, never the reverse.

    And the copy is taken *after* the caller loaded the set it describes, so a
    landed file edited in between is replayed as it is now rather than as it was
    read. That is the examine-to-move window ADR-0027 decision 2 records as its
    third residue, not a new one: the window exists because the accept path's
    moves are not under the write lock, and this lengthens it rather than
    opening it.

    **A landed read that refuses an irregular file names it** (the
    ``application/proposal_service.py::_commit`` shape, #400). A landed body
    can be swapped for a FIFO, socket or device between the caller's load and
    this copy -- the same window the paragraph above already records for an
    edited one -- and left bare,
    :class:`~theurian.domain.errors.IrregularSourceFileError` would propagate
    saying only that *a* file is irregular, naming none of ``candidate.landed``.
    ``relative`` is safe to attach: it is not an authored string but
    ``candidate.landed``'s own entries, which :meth:`ProposalService._candidate`
    builds from what the loader itself recorded when the landed set was
    originally read (``migration.source_path``,
